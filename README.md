Introduction
------------

inoERP is an open source php based enterprise management system. 
The ERP systems contain all the required modules for running any small to midsize businesses.
The features are very similar to Oracle R12/ Fusion Application and SAP. 
It also contains a lightweight CMS which seamlessly integrates with the ERP

Why inoERP 
------------

The idea behind inoERP is to provide a dynamic pull-based system where the demand /supply changes frequently and traditional planning systems 
(such as MRP or Kanban) are incompetent to provide a good inventory turn.

What is Dynamic pull System
-------------------------------

Dynamic pull system is an advanced version of pull system which encompasses the best feature of traditional pull system & MRP. 
The major disadvantage of traditional Kanban system is the fixed Kanban size and requirement of at least 2 bins for full operation.
In the event of sudden demand decrease, Kanban system can result in extra inventory and the value of unused inventory can go up to 2 bin size. 
Similarly, In case of unexpected demand increasing, it can result in line down and the issue will be severe if the lead times are not short.


Dynamic pull system overcomes this issue by recalculating the bucket size (Kanban size/lot size) before creating any supply 
(requisitions/purchase order/work order). Each time a new supply is created, system automatically decides the best supply size as per the 
existing actual demand.

Requirements & Installation
=========================

== Requirements ==

1. HTTP web server Ex. Nginx, Apache, IIS, Oracle HTTP
2. PHP 5.5+ for versions upto 0.4.1 , and PHP 7+ for versions => 0.5.1   
3. MySQL(Server version: 5.6.17+) or MariaDB
    
== Auto Installation ==

1. Upload all the files on the web server
2. If using Apache then enable mod_rewrite module before you proceed further
3. Open the index.php /or install.php page and follow the simple four steps installation process (mySQL user should have all the privileges equivalent to root a user to create views. You can change to a lesser privileged user after installation by changing the username & password @ include\basics\dbsettings.inc)
4. Login into the application using user id /password - admin/admin

== Manual Installation ==

1. Change the DB settings @ include\basics\dbsettings.inc
2. Change the session_set_cookie_params  in sessions file
3. Import the database file @  enine\install\inoerp.sql
4. Change the .htaccess
5. Login in to the application using user id /password - admin/admin

== Security Consideration ==

It is always advisable to keep the settings files outside the public directory. If you decide to keep the settings folder in the root directory, then make below two changes

1. Modify basics.inc @ includes\basic modify     
require_once(INC_BASICS . DS .  'settings'. DS. "dbsettings.inc");  
to  
require_once(HOME_DIR . DS .  '/../settings'. DS. "dbsettings.inc");

2. Modify inomail file @ includes\general_class  
include_once __DIR__.'/../basics/settings/mailsettings.inc';  
to  
require_once(HOME_DIR . DS .  '/../settings'. DS. "mailsettings.inc");


== Optional setup ==


If Auto-Schedule/run of any program is required then schedule the main program modules/sys/program/start_program.php via a cron job.
