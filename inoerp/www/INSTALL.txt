It is always advisable to keep the settings files outside the public directory. If you decide to keep the settings folder in the root directory, then make below two changes

1. Modify basics.inc @ includes\basic modify     
require_once(INC_BASICS . DS .  'settings'. DS. "dbsettings.php");  
to  
require_once(HOME_DIR . DS .  '/../settings'. DS. "dbsettings.php");

2. Modify inomail file @ includes\general_class  
include_once __DIR__.'/../basics/settings/mailsettings.inc';  
to  
require_once(HOME_DIR . DS .  '/../settings'. DS. "mailsettings.inc");

If Auto-Schedule/run of any program is required then schedule the main program modules/sys/program/start_program.php via a cron job.
